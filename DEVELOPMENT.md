The purpose of this document is to describe to developers how to navigate this repository
in order to make meaningful contributions to this product.

## Getting Started

To get started building, testing, or contributing to this repository, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [git](https://git-scm.com/).
Node is expected to be either version 14 or 16.

```
git clone https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab.git
cd traceability-vocab
npm i
```

To run a local version of the [spec](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/) you can run:

```
npx serve ./docs
```

## Directory Structure

The primary focus of this repository is to define schemas which describe Verifiable Credentials which act as a digitally
equivalent signed form of a document. These credentials can be found in the `/docs/openapi/components/schemas/credentials/`
directory, starting from the root of this repository.

To enable standard re-usable parts for defining RDF classes in credentials, we have a `common` folder located at
`/docs/openapi/components/schemas/common/` in which we store these classes. As a comparison to React, think of `credentials` as
top-level pages, and think of `common` as the components that make up these pages.

Presentations are a way to exchange credentials between parties. Presentations can have a specific schema or structure
that defines a specific workflow. One such workflow definition would be a workflow for importing steel. Presentation
definitions can be found in the `/docs/openapi/components/schemas/presentations/` directory.

When the `npm i` command is run, it will generate the JSON-LD context from the schemas. This context is found at
`/docs/contexts/traceability-v1.jsonld` from the root of this repository.

There are several scripts in this repository for compiling trace vocabulary. These scripts can be found in the
`/packages/traceability-schemas/scripts/` directory from the root of this repository. That directory contains
`README.md` which describes the specifics of each script and what it does.

The specification is in the `/docs` folder from the root of the repository. The `index.html` file contains the static
text that can be found in the spec. This document references different sections which can be found in the `/docs/sections`
directory.

## Conventions

While there are not any strict conventions, there are specific guidelines that are followed
for defining a consistent style with respect to schemas. They are described as follows.

1. Verifiable Credentials should not declare any top-level properties not defined in the [vc-core spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
2. All of the properties for a credential type should be declared in the `credentialSubject`
3. `type` properties should be declared as an array for simplification
4. An attempt should be made to use existing `common` types before declaring new ones
5. RDF classes should not be declared with any undefined terms
6. Example JSON files must include _all_ of the properties defined in the JSON schema

## Continuous Integration

When submitting a pull request, the proposed changes must pass the Continuous Integration tests.
These tests can be run in the local developer environment by running `npm test` from the root
of the repository. This will run the tests located in the `/packages/traceability-schemas/__tests__/`
folder.

Common errors when not passing these tests include:

1. Malformed or incorrect `.yml` indentation
2. Incorrect OpenAPI `.yml` syntax
3. Broken proofs as a result of context changes
4. Example JSON files that don't pass schema validation
5. Cascading changes as a result of changing a `common` RDF class used by multiple files

## Continuous Deployment

After a pull request is merged, the Continuous Delivery (CD) script will create the spec document
which is deployed to [https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/).
The scripts which produce this document are described as follows.

1. `schemas-to-openapi.js` builds the YAML (`.yml`) file for the [OpenAPI Spec](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/openapi/)
2. `openapi-to-context.js` builds the JSON-LD context from the OpenAPI spec which is written to `/docs/contexts/traceability-v1.jsonld`
3. `schemas-to-vocab.js` builds the HTML (`.html`) files for the schemas which are referenced from `/docs/index.html` in the spec
